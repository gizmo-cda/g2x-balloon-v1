# WGS84

WGS84 is an acronym for `World Geodetic System`. The GPS coordinate system is based on this standard. More details can be found below:

# ECEF

ECEF is an acronym for `Earth-Centered, Earth-Fixed`. This is an alternate 3D Cartesian coordinate system that places the Earth's center of mass at the origin. More details can be found below:
